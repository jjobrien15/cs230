The Gaming Room, our client, requested the design of a scalable web-based version of their Android game, Draw it or Lose it. This multiplayer guessing game required support for multiple teams and players, unique game and team names, and a single game instance for efficient resource management. The solution emphasized scalability, security, and efficiency through a Linux-based cloud platform, leveraging design patterns like singleton for memory management and iterator for unique IDs. These features aligned with the clientâ€™s goals of providing a seamless, cross-platform experience while allowing for future enhancements.

The documentation process was particularly useful in organizing requirements, constraints, and technical strategies, ensuring clarity and alignment with user needs. The structured approach allowed potential challenges to be addressed early, streamlining development. The Evaluation section could be improved by including detailed benchmarks or case studies to better justify platform recommendations. Interpreting and prioritizing user needs, such as ensuring a user-friendly interface and robust security, guided the design choices and demonstrated the importance of focusing on end-user value. For future projects, incorporating early user feedback and iterating on design through usability testing will enhance the process further.
